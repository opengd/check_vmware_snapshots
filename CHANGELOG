 2013/04/26 - v0.13 
              	added parameter 'separator' to specify another msg separator than comma. (Thanks to Olaf Assmus).
                    Examples: 
                    --separator '<br>' : Nagios sees the whole output as a single line. All snapshots/VMs
                                         are displayed as well in service overview as in service details. 
                                         Each message gets its own line. 
                    --separator '\n'   : Nagios sees n lines. Only the first line is displayed in the service overview.
                                         All lines are displayed in the service details. 
                                         Each message gets its own line. 
              First Output line is now a summation of the badcount.
